    	The Project for FLL is when you have to create/innovate a solution to a certain problem. Each year, there is a topic, which the project and robot is based on. This year's topic is World Class, which is about improving the way someone learns something. The question that we're supposed to answer is...
	How can you improve the way someone learns ____ ?
	After a lot of brainstorming and list creating, we finally decided that we wanted to help people learn social studies. We chose social studies, because we thought that we didn't like the way that social studies was taught. Most teachers taught social studies by making us read, saying lecture, basically forcing facts into our brain. 
	In 7th grade, 4 of us had a social studies teacher named Ms. Johnson. We enjoyed Ms. Johnson's class, because she incorporated many activities/games into her teaching. Those activities actually helped us to learn new things.
	Based on our past experiences, we decided to create a geography and history board game called...
GEOPOLY! (LBF edition)
[insert interactive map picture here]
	Geopoly is based on Monopoly, but there are other factors incorporated into the board game. Geopoly is fun and interactive, but you can also learn!1 In Geopoly, you are an explorer (your game pieces are lego pieces) that travels on the board, trying to get 100,000 treasures before the other players do. You can learn facts about world history events, by the History Events (Chance) and United Nations (Community Chest) cards. There are also challenge questions, which links to our interactive map.
	What is the interactive map, you might ask?
	Introducing... the other part of our solution, which is called the 
Interactive Map!
<br /><a href="map.html"><img src="map.png" id="mapPic"/></a><br />
	The interactive map is a online map, where you can learn about geography and history. There are two modes for the interactive map. 
Free browse mode: Where you can explore the interactive map... and have fun!
Challenge mode: the challenge mode is linked to the board game. In the board game, there are moments where you have to answer challenge questions. You can get those questions in the interactive map. But, you don't need to play the board game to access game mode. If you're just in the mood to learn some social studies, then you can also answer the challenge questions provided.

	And that was a brief overview of our project.
